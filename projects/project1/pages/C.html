   <p>C is as big a deal as you can get in computing. Created by Dennis Ritchie starting in the late 1960s at Bell Labs, it’s the principal development language of the UNIX operating system. Unix (lowercased now, to refer to the idea of Unix instead of the branded version) is a simple operating system—basically it’s a kernel12 that manages memory and runs software, a large collection of very small utility programs, and a “shell” that helps you knit programs into “shell scripts.” If you couldn’t do what you needed with shell scripts, you might write a new utility in C and add it to the utility library. This was a nice and practical way of working, and it coincided with the rise of various kinds of networks that today we refer to collectively as the Internet. So Unix spread from Bell Labs to academia, to large industrial systems, and eventually leached into the water supply of computing until it was everywhere. And everywhere that Unix went, C was sure to go.</p>

   
   <p>C’s legendary, lucid manual and specification, The C Programming Language, written by Ritchie and Brian Kernighan (known by its nickname, K&R), is a quick and simple read—physically light in comparison with modern, heavy-stock guides to programming on bookstore shelves. This recommended text was published in 1978, when personal computing barely existed, back when a computer was a large piece of industrial equipment used to control a refrigeration system or calculate actuarial tables. It was in K&R that “Hello, world!” became the canonical example program for any language. By convention, almost every introduction to any programming language since then starts with a variation on “Hello, world!”</p>

  <p>Here is the ur-text of computational self-introduction:</p>

  </div>

  <p>Which will, when compiled and run, print “Hello, world!” to the screen. Let’s write a program where you give it a number x and it prints out all the squares of the numbers from 1 to x—just the sort of practical, useful program that always appears in programming tutorials to address the needs of people who urgently require a list of squares.</p>

    <img src="/Users/mahaswetajayachandran/Documents/webdesign/paulford/img/2.jpg "alt="lib"  style="height:250px">
  </div>

  <p>To compile this program on a Macintosh, I saved it as squares.c and opened up Terminal.app and typed:</p>
  <div class="img4">
    <img src="/Users/mahaswetajayachandran/Documents/webdesign/paulford/img/3.jpg " alt="lib" style="height:50px">
  </div>
  <p>And it produced:</p>
  <div class="img4">
    <img src="/Users/mahaswetajayachandran/Documents/webdesign/paulford/img/four.jpg " alt="lib" style="height:25px">
  </div>

  <p>That runs the GNU C Compiler and produces a default file called a.out, which I ran on the command line, 13 to get my squared numbers, and bully for me. If I wanted to change the code, I would run the commands, and the program would update accordingly.</p>
